Missing data is a pervasive problem in longitudinal data analysis. Several single-imputation (SI) and multiple-imputation (MI) approaches have been proposed to address this issue. In SI approaches, a single value is estimated for each missing data point. MI approaches are flexible and popular methods for imputing missing values based on three steps: the imputation step, the analysis step, and the pooling step. These approaches can be decomposed into two approaches: joint modelling (JM) and fully conditional specification (FCS).

We published a paper about “A wide range of missing imputation approaches in longitudinal data: a simulationstudy and real data analysis” in BMC Medical Research Methodology. We compared the performance of SI and MI approaches for imputing missing longitudinal data and assessed them on real data and in a simulation study. R software was used to impute missing longitudinal data and to analyze the data. The R code for the SI and MI approaches to missing data imputation and data simulation is available at https://github. com/MinaJahang iri/R-codes-of-missing-imputation- methods.
